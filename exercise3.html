			<p>Brock Obama was born on June 19th, 1997, in the town of Bridgeport, California. There he spent his days writing short stories about watching grass grow from the perspective of an ant. Once he was of age, his parents sent him off to study abroad in Hong Kong. He was educated in metallurgy and later went to discover the Obama Process, which was a revolutionary new way to stabilize unbalanced isotopes of radioactive elements and prolonging their half-life. Obama recieved 38 nobel prizes for his discovery.</p>
